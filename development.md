# Development

## Colors

Please see [./color-guide.json](./color-guide.json) for a list of the colors used in this theme.

## Note

The below sections represent some of the default readme and quickstart guides that come with the generated theme, yet still seem useful for further development.

## Development - Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme.
* Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).

## Development - Adopt your theme to Visual Studio Code

* The token colorization is done based on standard TextMate themes. Colors are matched against one or more scopes.

To learn more about scopes and how they're used, check out the [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme) documentation.

## Development - Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.
